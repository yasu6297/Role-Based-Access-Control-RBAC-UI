# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Project Overview

This project is a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** User Interface (UI) designed to manage users, roles, and permissions effectively within an admin dashboard. The project leverages **React** to build the frontend and simulates CRUD operations using mock APIs. The goal is to provide a user-friendly interface for managing access control based on roles and permissions.

---

## Features

- **User Management**
  - View, add, edit, and delete users.
  - Assign roles to users (e.g., Admin, User).
  - Manage user statuses (Active/Inactive).

- **Role Management**
  - View, add, edit, and delete roles.
  - Assign permissions to roles (e.g., View Dashboard, Manage Users).

- **Permission Management**
  - View, add, edit, and delete permissions.
  - Assign permissions to roles for access control.

- **Mock API Simulation**
  - Simulated API calls for CRUD operations on users, roles, and permissions.
  - Local data storage to demonstrate functionality.

- **Confirmation Dialogs**
  - Action confirmation dialogs to prevent accidental changes like deletions or updates.

- **Responsive UI**
  - Clean, intuitive interface with a responsive design for different devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React** - JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React-Bootstrap** - Bootstrap components for React-based styling and UI.
- **Axios** - HTTP client for making API requests (simulated in this case).
- **React Router** - Routing library for navigation within the app.
- **Mock APIs** - Used to simulate CRUD operations for demonstration purposes.
